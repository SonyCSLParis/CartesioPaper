# README - Setup Guide for Virtual Environment

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the virtual environment required for running the Python analysis code. The code utilizes several libraries including `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`.

## Prerequisites
- Python (latest stable release recommended)
- Git (for version control, optional)
- Command Line Interface (CLI) such as Terminal on MacOS/Linux or Command Prompt/Powershell on Windows.

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment

### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If the code is hosted on a version control platform like GitHub:
```bash
git clone [URL of the Repository]
cd [Repository Name]
```

### 2. Creating a Virtual Environment
Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment.
```bash
# On MacOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activating the Virtual Environment
Activate the created virtual environment.
```bash
# On MacOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Installing Dependencies
Install the required libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Deactivating the Virtual Environment
After running the code, you can deactivate the virtual environment.
```bash
deactivate
```

## Running the Code
With the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, you can now run the Python scripts in your project.

```bash
python [script_name].py
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with library versions or compatibility, ensure you're using the Python version recommended and the correct versions of the libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your data files, if any, are placed in the designated directories as per the project's file structure.
- For any specific configurations or environment variables, refer to the project's documentation.
